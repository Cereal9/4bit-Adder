# 4bit-Adder
In this project a 4-bit adder, whose graphical representation is in Figure 1, is going to be implemented in the FPGA. This 4-bit 
adder is constructed using 4 1-bit full adders Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA). The board used to implement this 4-bit adder 
is the Altera CycloneÂ® V SE 5CSXFC6D6F31C6N device. Two VHDL concepts are required for this project. 
- Instantiation
- Singals
Instantiation refers to the action of calling a previously designed block in VHDL from the
architecture of a higher hierarchy. For example, the full adder is going to be designed in VHDL
and instantiated from the 4-bit Parallel Adder, which is a higher hierarchy VHDL design.
Instantiation of the FullAdder entity requires the following steps:
1. Both VHDL files the FullAdder and the FourBitAdder to be included in the project files.
2. In the higher hierarchy VHDL file, the FourBitAdder, the entity of the full adder is copied as a COMPONENT after the architecture declaration and before begin of the architecture
3. Create an instantiation of the FullAdder component after the architecture begin and do a port mapping. The port mapping is carried out by declaring what inputs, outputs, or signals are going to connect to the port of the component.
