# 4bit-Adder
In this project a 4-bit adder, whose graphical representation is in Figure 1, is going to be implemented in the FPGA. This 4-bit 
adder is constructed using 4 1-bit full adders Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA). The board used to implement this 4-bit adder 
is the Altera CycloneÂ® V SE 5CSXFC6D6F31C6N device. Two VHDL concepts are required for this project. They are instantiation and the 
use of signals.
- Instantiation
- Singals
